# Replication demo

This repository is a part of the "Introduction to GitHub" workshop. Here, we reinforce the concepts surrounding the consumer workflow in GitHub. Click [here](https://dceg-workshops.github.io/fair_principles_for_data_stewardship/workshops/workshop_2/practical) to learn more.

Specifically,

1.  `code_injection.R`: an example of a script that can be easily executed remotely using R's `source` function.
2.  `generate_citation_from_bibtex.R`: a script showing how to generate GitHub CITATION metadata.
3.  `modeling.R`: a script building a logistic model using private data. You will not be able to access the specific data used in this script. However, during the workshop, you had access to a very similar dataset `workshop_bc_data.csv`. Can you substitute that data into this script and try comparing the results? Are the results replicable?
4.  `model.txt`: summary statistics from the logistic model that was built in the script `modeling.R`.
